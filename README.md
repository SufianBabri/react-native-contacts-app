This is a contacts viewing app that is built with Expo/React Native to demonstrate my expertise in the mobile development.

## Features

2. Contacts listing (with `expo-contacts`)
3. Stack Navigation (with `react-navigation`)
4. Graceful handling of permissions
5. Clean code

## Demonstrated React Concepts

1. Function components
2. React hooks (`useCallback`, `useState`, `useEffect`)
3. Custom hooks

Running this project is pretty simple if you have set up Expo on your system. If not, please visit Expo's [Getting Started](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

Once Expo is set up, clone this repo and `cd` into the directory.
